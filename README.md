**Betting Rule**

Before rolling the dice, players must place their bets on the various available bet types.
The available bet types in the game are "Big", "Small", and "Triple".

**"Big" or "Small" Bet:**

• To place a "Big"/"Small" bet, click on the "Big"/"Small" button.

• A "Big" bet wins if the total sum of the three dice is between 11 and 17 (excluding triples).

• A "Small" bet wins if the total sum of the three dice is between 4 and 10 (excluding triples).

• If the total sum falls within this range, the player wins tokens equal to their bet amount.

• If the total sum is outside this range, the player loses their bet amount.

**Triple Bet:**

To place a "Triple" bet, click on the "Triple" button.
A "Triple" bet wins if all three dice show the same number.
If the dice show a triple, the player wins tokens equal to their bet amount multiplied by 30.
If the dice do not show a triple, the player loses their bet amount.

**Rolling the Dice:**

• Once the player has placed their bet amount and selected a bet type, they can click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.

• The game will generate random numbers between 1 and 6 for each of the three dice.

• The dice images will update to display the values of the rolled dice.

**Result:**

• After the dice have been rolled, the game will calculate the total sum of the dice values.

• Depending on the selected bet type and the result of the dice roll, the player may win or lose tokens.

• The game will display the total sum of the dice and the corresponding result (win or loss) along with the token count.

**Token Count:**

• The player starts with 100 tokens.

• The token count is displayed on the screen and updates after each roll based on the outcome of the bet.

• If the player runs out of tokens, they will not be able to place bets until they have enough tokens.

**Repeat:**

• Players can continue playing by placing new bets and rolling the dice for each round.

• The gameplay will repeat, allowing players to try their luck and win more tokens.

Enjoy the game and have fun!
